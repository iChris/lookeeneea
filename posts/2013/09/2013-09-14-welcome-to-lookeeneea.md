So, thanks to my awesome brother in law Chris, we have a place to blog about our journey as we walk through the world of childhood cancer. I asked Sam to write out the word leukaemia, which is where we got the title of the blog. It is a bit of a crazy time for us, so I can't guarantee how complete or up to date the blog will be, but I will give it a go:)
