On Monday Sept 9, the teachers from Sam's school, Hinterland Christian College came up to visit. They brought the biggest card in the world! It was covered in rockets that each student had written on as a message to Sam. They also brought in the first carrot from the school garden and presented that to Sam. There were many gifts that students had sent up for Sam, we could feel the love as the students sent up their own treasures to Sam to help ease his time in the hospital.
