This used to be a brilliant little video of Sam talking about what life might be like with no hair. Unfortunately, Sam is not keen on the video and would prefer it not to be public. In the interest of having Sam feel safe talking with us, and in control of the information about his situation, I have pulled the video from this blog.

The last thing we would like as parents, in a time when Sam feels like he has lost all control, is to take a little bit more away from him.
