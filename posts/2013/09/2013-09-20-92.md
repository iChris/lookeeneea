Sunday the 8th of May, we arrived at the Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane. Lorinda and Sam arrived by ambulance transfer from Tweed Heads Hospital, and I was driven up by a couple of good friends after going home to pack some clothes for our time in Brisbane.Â At this point we still didn't have any information about Leukaemia or it's treatment, we were very overwhelmed by the immensity of it all.
