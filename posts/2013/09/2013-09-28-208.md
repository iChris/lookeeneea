Sam:"Sometimes Mommy is scared sometimes, like when she is talking to the doctors, and I, like don't know what they are talking about, but Mom fully gets it, and then she just bursts into tears."

Lorinda: "I _was_ scared when the doctors said you had Leukaemia because I didn't want you to be sick. What were you thinking then?"

Sam:"I was thinking I'm gonna be O.K., and it's alright."
