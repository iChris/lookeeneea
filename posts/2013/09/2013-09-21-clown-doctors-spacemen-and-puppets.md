Thank you, thank you! to all the people who volunteer their time to help put a smile on a little person's face. As we all know, hospitals are not exactly where you choose to go for a good time, but having unexpected funny visitors sure helped to brighten up the day.

The Clown Doctors came and blew bubbles to clean Sam's feet, The Starlight Foundation did magic tricks, and Camp Quality brought in a puppet.
