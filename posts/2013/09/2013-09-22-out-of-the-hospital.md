On Friday Sam got another dose of Chemo, after which Sam was to be allowed to leave the hospital, and stay in our accommodation nearby, and be treated as an outpatient. While Sam was getting the chemo, one of his good mates came to visit, which was awesome! The only thing was that Sam had to stay in his bed for 3 hours just in case he had a reaction with the chemo. Not that fun when you want to go play with your friend. However, at least Sam was able to share the joy of hospital bed riding with someone who could appreciate it.

It was so nice to have dinner together as a family outside of the hospital. It had only been 6 days but it felt like it had been a month. We now needed to stay in Brisbane for at least another 3 weeks, while Sam was given his treatment as an outpatient.\[gallery type="rectangular" ids="80,81,87,88,85,84"\]
