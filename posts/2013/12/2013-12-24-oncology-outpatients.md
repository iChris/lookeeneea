At the moment, our regular routine includes a trip to Tweed Hospital to get a blood test and another trip up to Brisbane for chemo.  My parents joined us on our last trip up and my dad wrote a great blog post describing the experience.  You can find it [here](http://oatstravels.tumblr.com/post/70370514372/when-a-6-year-old-visits-rch "When a 6 year old visits RCH").  It's a great description of what our chemo days generally look like.
