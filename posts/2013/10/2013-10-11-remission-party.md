We are back home!!!

Yesterday at 12:30, we were informed that Sam is officially in remission. Which, I think means that he has less than 0.1% leukaemic cells in his blood. And which also meant we got to go home. Which is awesome. So awesome, in fact that we decided to throw a party. So we invited everyone who was in our house at the time, made a classic Mennonite meal that Sam loves, and then got out on the dance floor and danced the night away. Or at least we danced until bedtime. Which is 7:30 for some of us.

Though we know there is still a long road ahead, we wanted to celebrate what we have been through, and let our hearts be filled with thankfulness for the grace we have been given so far. I guess it is fitting that this weekend is Thanksgiving weekend in our homeland. We have much to be thankful for.
