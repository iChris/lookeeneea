There certainly is a lot of waiting in this journey. Waiting to see doctors, waiting for blood results, waiting to get your prescription filled, waiting for the nurse to come and stop the beeping on the I.V. Waiting for the blood from the blood bank, and the list goes on....

Right now we are waiting for the bone marrow results - the official word that Sam is in remission.  Or isn't.  We're waiting for the thumbs up to go home.

It's hard to make plans when you're waiting and it's one more lesson in taking each day as it comes and enjoying the moment.
