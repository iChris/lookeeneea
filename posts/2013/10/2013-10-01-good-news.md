We took Sam in to the hospital for his chemo again today, and had a good chat with his doctor. The results from the bone marrow sample that had been sent to the U.S. for specialized testing had come back, and the results were encouraging. I don't understand the biology behind it all, but I think they look at specific chromosomes in the blast cells, and that gives an indication of how well they typically will respond to treatment. Anyways, she said a bunch of big words that meant: "good news, Sam's leukaemia is quite common, and very treatable." That was great to hear.

So, if all goes well with Sam's blood test next Monday, he will have chemo on Tuesday and then we will likely be able to go home, like our real home. The home we left 3 1/2 weeks ago with the groceries on the floor, expecting to stay one or two nights in the hospital. Yay! Of course we still have a week to go, and a few more boxes to check, but it is looking good so far.

After we get home, we will still be coming up here once a week for treatment, on and off at different times and intervals for the next couple of years, which still is yet to be spelled out, depending on his bone marrow results at the end of this induction treatment. So that's where we are at, and we are very proud of our courageous little boy!

(oh, yeah, thanks to some of our awesome friends, the groceries are not still on the floor in case you were wondering:)
