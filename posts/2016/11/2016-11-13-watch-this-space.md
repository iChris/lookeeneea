Earlier this week, Sam took his final methotrexate chemotherapy pills.  Every Tuesday he's been taking 12 methotrexate tablets and 1 mercaptopurine tablet.  He practised taking more and more of them at once until he got all of them down in two goes: he takes 6 or 7 at once!  We're very nearly done now…it's down to his final daily chemo dose which ends on Monday, Nov 14.  I can hardly believe it's finally happening.
