I haven't posted for a while on this blog, we have been quite busy, and Sam has been doing quite well. However, there are still some things that I would like to share, so I might just break them into bite sized posts and see how far I get:)

We go in to Tweed Heads Hospital almost weekly to get Sam's blood tested, and it is nice that we are getting to know the nursing staff there a bit. One day  after another blood test, we got a call from one of the nurses asking if we would like to go to "Dream Night", a night at the zoo put on for kids who have serious medical conditions. We figured that would be great, so one evening in early December, after the zoo closed to the public, we gathered with a bunch of other sick children and families, and got to experience our first Dream Night.

The night was put on mostly by volunteers, from what I could tell, and they were all so happy to be there putting smiles on all the little faces. We got a free meal, a photo with a koala, there were animals being brought around that the kids could touch, lots of people dressed up in costumes, face painting, a magic show, free ice blocks…… What can I say, it was an amazing night. So, a big thanks to everyone at Currumbin WIldlife Sanctuary who volunteered their time and resources for that night!

Something I am realising is the importance of giving kids special experiences like this. They have to miss out on so many things that other kids get to do, I think it empowers them to know that they are valuable enough that people would do this just for them.
