Found this little video segment that my Dad took in October, This is the first time we administered Sam's Chemo pills at home. Before we left the hospital with his pills, the Nurse gave us this big pile of safety gear to use while cutting and administering the pills to Sam. Now, call me crazy, but to me it felt like a little bit of overkill, however it provided a good laugh for us all, and you know what they say about laughter being the best medicine!

I must say though, it does make me shake my head to think that I am supposed to go to such lengths to protect myself from this cytotoxic drug, which I then place in the palm of my six year olds hand and ask him to swallow it.

I reckon it's time we found a real cure.
