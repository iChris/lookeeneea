Sometimes people are surprisingly awesome.

For instance: the lady I don't really know from somewhere in the U.S. who sent us an email after reading this blog.  She was touched by Sam's story and wished she could do something, but living on the other side of the world made it a wee bit difficult. So what did she do?

She gave blood, and committed to doing it regularly. In her words,

"

> Unfortunately living so far away, it will never benefit him directly but you can know that because of your story, someone else will get the transfusion that they need.  And Sam can tell his friends that he helped heal someone from the US."

How cool is that. I had a pretty good cry when I read that email.

More stuff like this on the news, and maybe people wouldn't be so depressed.

Just a thought.
