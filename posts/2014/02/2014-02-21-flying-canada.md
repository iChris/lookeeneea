Yesterday Sam and I flew from Australia to Canada.

Well, I suppose that wouldn't be quite correct, but there were a lot of similarities.

We started off at 6:15am, we were running a bit late for the flight, but still made it on before it left.  First, we had a 2 hr domestic flight  to Brisbane, then for the main leg of the journey, we had our own first class berth (we were in quarantine), and many stewardesses coming to check up on us and make sure everything was O.K. It was however disappointing that there was no in flight meal ( Sam had to fast for his upcoming surgery) but we kept ourselves occupied with the in flight entertainment system, reading books and playing many rounds of I spy. At one point Sam even fell asleep (helped by the anaesthetist and his white liquid), at which point I was able to go for a walk up and down the aisle to stretch my legs and get a cup of hot chocolate.

One feature that hasn't made it on to most commercial flights yet, was the pee jar- especially handy when you are sitting near the window and the 2 people beside you both have their tray tables down and you really have to go because you are hooked up to an I.V., which is pumping you full of fluid. Just politely call a stewardess, get a jar, and hand it in when finished. Too easy.

After Sam's sleep, the stewardesses gave him some more medicine for the next three hours of the flight, and then we were able to transfer back to domestic, making sure to bring with us the complimentary bag of needles, goggles and gloves, that they provide for your comfort on the flight. The last domestic leg was a bit longer than the first, as we had to refuel halfway, giving Sam and I a chance to grab a pizza. 15 hours after we had left, we both stumbled up the steps (Sam had more reason to, as he had a new insuflon port thingy which had just been inserted in his leg) and we flopped down on our beds exhausted.

AAAHH, Canada at last!
