Here are a few photos from a photo shoot Sam and I did a little while ago. He wanted to do a bunch of photos with the theme of "hats". Once he ran out of hats, out came the sunglasses. It was a fun way to spend the day together when his immunity and energy levels were too low to go to school.[\[gallery type="slideshow" ids="350,351,347,346,343,344,348,345,349"\]
